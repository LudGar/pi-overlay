all those tiney but big files will be dropped here. 4096 digits with about 15500px in length but only 13KB in size.

Okey... the Overlay Pro just supports data up 1000x1000 px in size... great...

So i will do 200 digits instead of 100 since each length of a 100 digits is about 350-400 that will give me at least close to the limit-

-yay
